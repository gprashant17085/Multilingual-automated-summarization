# Multilingual-automated-summarization
We aim to develop an automated system for multi-lingual text summarization to effectively  capture important features of the text in vari- ous languages. In this project, we propose the  pipeline for the task (Source language: Span- ish; Target language: English) as a two-stage  approach - translating the text from Spanish to  English and then summarizing the English ar- ticle. We utilize OpenNMT to train and eval- uate our models. We leverage various paral- lel corpora to verify our hypothesis that spo- ken/informal language corpus helps transla- tion models have better generalizability than  the formal datasets do for domain-specific ap- plications. The evaluation results show that the  models trained on the spoken language dataset perform better compared to the models trained on the formal language dataset.
