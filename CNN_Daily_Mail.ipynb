the hype surrounding its first watch , the iphone is still the engine behind apple 's phenomenal success , its latest figures have revealed . the results far surpassed most analysts ' expectations for the first three months of the year , when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak . apple sold more than 61 million iphones in the quarter , accounting for more than two-thirds of its $ 58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion 's share of its $ 13.6 billion in profit - and up 40 % from a year ago . sales of iphones in china were also revealed to have outstripped those in the us . apple sold more than 61 million iphones in the quarter , accounting for more than two-thirds of its $ 58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion 's share of its $ 13.6 billion in profit . $ 58 billion in revenue , $ 13.6 billion in profit . $ 200 billion in cash , up from around $ 150 billion a year ago . more than 61 million iphones sole . ipad revenue fell 29 % to $ 5.4 billion . revenue from mac computers rose 2 % from a year earlier , to $ 5.6 billion . ` we are thrilled by the continued strength of iphone , mac and the app store , which drove our best march quarter results ever , ' said tim cook , apple 's ceo . ` we 're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iphone than we 've experienced in previous cycles , and we 're off to an exciting start to the june quarter with the launch of apple watch . ' as expected , the numbers were down from the previous quarter , when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of apple 's new iphone 6 , 6 plus and older models . but it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iphones sold in the first three months of 2014 . ` we 're seeing great results all over the world , ' apple chief financial officer luca maestri told the associated press , adding that iphone sales grew 72 percent in china , where the company has big hopes for expansion . other products played a much smaller role . revenue from mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier , to $ 5.6 billion , while ipad revenue fell 29 percent , to $ 5.4 billion -- continuing a steady decline in tablet sales . apple did n't report any results for the new apple watch , which it began selling this month , after the quarter ended . maestri said customer response had been ` positive . ' analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date , suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions . apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year , making it the world 's most valuable company . ` it 's been really great to see the reaction of customers , ' said cook . ` the response has been overwhelming . we ca n't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up . ' the iphone is another story . since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall , apple has vied with south korea 's samsung for the no. 1 position in the global smartphone market . by some estimates , apple outsold samsung in the quarter that ended in december , and analysts will be watching closely when samsung reports its latest results this week . apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors . the company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent , to 52 cents a share , and has increased a $ 90 billion stock buyback program to $ 140 billion . apple did n't report any results for the new apple watch , which it began selling this month , after the quarter ended . in total , the company said the program will return $ 200 billion to investors by the end of march 2017 . as iphone sales have surged , so has apple 's stock . apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year , making it the world 's most valuable company . the stock closed monday at $ 132.65 , up 1.8 percent for the day , and was rising in late trading . the iphone is n't just apple 's ` dominant product , ' said frank gillett , a tech industry analyst at forrester research . ` it 's more than anything else what 's driving the success of their company . ' market researchers , however , expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year , particularly at the higher price range where apple competes , as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one . that could make it difficult for apple to maintain its recent pace . ` they 're extremely dependent on the iphone , ' said investment colin gillis at bgc partners . ` at some point , the market dynamics change , ' he said , adding that ` the question is what could replace the iphone ' if sales begin to slow . customers looking at apple iphones in an apple store in shanghai , china , on january 14 , 2014 . apple ceo tim cook has said he 's optimistic about new markets such as china , where apple has made a strong showing against samsung and china 's xiaomi . and even if apple is increasingly selling new iphones to people who are simply upgrading older models , ` that 's still a pretty healthy market , ' said gartner analyst van baker , noting that more than 700 million iphones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007 . maestri also stressed the potential for new products like apple watch and apple pay , the company 's mobile payment service . while these currently provide minimal revenue , analysts say they have big potential . and they are designed to work closely with the iphone , which means each may bolster the other 's popularity in the future , gillett said .\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"b8fu2I0FJ_1W","executionInfo":{"elapsed":364,"status":"ok","timestamp":1607058723076,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Agrawal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhHMsRh6AHHNkUZoLBw9KixeVpVnClzqmZrB8vpPA=s64","userId":"14279071542476640576"},"user_tz":300},"outputId":"f1ad6fbc-319e-4855-a928-6b896fc1f531"},"source":["data=data[5680:]\n","len(data)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["5810"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2KKflfaBKn_I"},"source":["with open(\"remaining_test.txt.src\",'w') as f: \n","  f.write('\\n'.join(data))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h0vq8FOsj3pU"},"source":["The CNN / Daily Mail dataset as processed by Nallapati et al.

'' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":86},"id":"nmymvF4fg25A","executionInfo":{"elapsed":22996,"status":"ok","timestamp":1606870887055,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Agrawal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhHMsRh6AHHNkUZoLBw9KixeVpVnClzqmZrB8vpPA=s64","userId":"14279071542476640576"},"user_tz":300},"outputId":"d17d8ce7-39ed-40c1-d593-dbaad477eff9"},"source":["train.loc[0,'target']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"<t> mentally ill inmates in miami are housed on the `` forgotten floor '' </t> <t> judge steven leifman says most are there as a result of `` avoidable felonies '' </t> <t> while cnn tours facility , patient shouts : `` i am the son of the president '' </t> <t> leifman says the system is unjust and he 's fighting for change . </t>\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":188},"id":"WugmJrYokd5t","executionInfo":{"elapsed":22990,"status":"ok","timestamp":1606870887056,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Agrawal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhHMsRh6AHHNkUZoLBw9KixeVpVnClzqmZrB8vpPA=s64","userId":"14279071542476640576"},"user_tz":300},"outputId":"1e1a7203-4101-4616-eac1-469cbed6ccfc"},"source":["train.loc[1,'source']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"london , england -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- harry potter star daniel radcliffe gains access to a reported # 20 million -lrb- $ 41.1 million -rrb- fortune as he turns 18 on monday , but he insists the money wo n't cast a spell on him . daniel radcliffe as harry potter in `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' to the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world , the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars , drink and celebrity parties . `` i do n't plan to be one of those people who , as soon as they turn 18 , suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar , '' he told an australian interviewer earlier this month . `` i do n't think i 'll be particularly extravagant . `` the things i like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and cds and dvds .
